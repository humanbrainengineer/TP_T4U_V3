Works on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS with kernel head v5.3.xxx using this repo. which you will need to git clone into a local folder

https://github.com/EntropicEffect/rtl8822bu

git clone https://github.com/EntropicEffect/rtl8822bu
Make sure you have build-essentials and dkms

sudo apt-get install build-essential dkms
After cloning, cd into that folder and run

cd rtl8822bu
make
sudo make install
sudo modprobe 88x2bu
Then connect to your Wi-Fi (Hopefully, both 2.4GHz and 5GHz should be detectable now)

Next, follow these steps to refine the installation and for an automatic rebuild on Ubuntu kernel image updates

sudo dkms add .
sudo dkms install -m 88x2bu -v 1.1
